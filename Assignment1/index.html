            <p class="lyric">Ah, if only our voices speak at night <br>
                Could ever reach the very edge of this world and the time<br>
                Instead of fading into air and dust<br>
                Then what will the words could ever be?<br>
                Farthest words from "probably"<br>
                Let's make a promise that will never fade<br>
                Let's say it together in count of three, oh<br>
                Ooh-oh-oh</p>

            <p class="lyric">Ah, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard<br>
                But lately I've lost sight of the truth in those words<br>
                I can't even remember when I gave up believing<br>
                What could have been the reason?<br>
                Ah, the very moment that the rain will stop<br>
                In the place rainbow born and dies<br>
                And where the end of this life lies<br>
                I've always been insisting there was something that I've longing for</p>

            <p class="lyric">One day we'll reach to emotions unexplored, unprecedented<br>
                We'll high-five love we've yet to discover and give a kiss to time<br>
                The five dimensions keeps on teasing me<br>
                But I will keep on looking at you, dear<br>
                Let's make a sign for when we say "Nice to meet you" again<br>
                I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name</p>
